# Bo's BattleShips

This is a front end Battleship game created with JavaScript as a focus. There were no packages used other than gh-pages to get the app running on a live URL. The use of React router dom would be advised but I wanted to practice and see the limits of what I could do without routes. Instead using states to dictate what and when certain components are shown while using the app.

```
npm create vite@latest
npm i gh-pages
```
Future Updates:

* Fix image resolving error at deployment.
* Versus play to play with someone at the same monitor.
* Multi player mode to play with someone over the web.
